# -Cognitive-Radio-Network
## This is an (Undergraduate Thesis) 

This project is Developed under the GNU Radio platform and CRTS 'Cognitive Radio Test System project which is funded By Virginia Tech '.

### Primary Users Engine:
This engine is dedicated to switch its operational channel by changing its center frequency:  fc.
only 3 states have been specified:
switching in a fixed pattern between channel_5, channel_4 and channel_3
or switching between channel_2, channel_1 and channel_0

# TODO:
1. Design our model (MLP-Multi Layer Percetron) which add the cognition feature to the Secondry users.
2. Generate the Data set which include the main features of the Observed RF    
3. channels[Channel_0,Channel_1,Channel_2,Channel_3,Channel_4,Channel_5]. The Meters/features will be [RSSI, EVM, PSD, NOISE FLOOR, BER, PER]
4. Train our Model to to adjust the proper weights.
  
5. Integrate the System where 5 nodes are involved: [Controller, 2 primary users, 2 secondry users, Spectrum analyzer]
